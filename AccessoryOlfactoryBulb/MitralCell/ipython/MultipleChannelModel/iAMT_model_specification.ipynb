A single representative cell morphology of an intrinsically oscilating accessory olfactory bulb mitral cell was chosen for the development of the model (see Figure above). The morphology parameters were saved as a .hoc file that was imported into \"neuroConstuct\". Some editing was needed to separate compartments into groups (soma, dendrites, axon) for specifying channel allocation.**  "

    "##Fitting the Passive Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**The specific passive parameters of the model were tuned in the model to target mean experimental measurements/estimates. The experimental parameters used for this process were somatic input resistance ($I_{Input}$), membrane time constant (${\\tau}_m$), membrane capcitance ($C_m$). For each tuning iteration a set of specific parameters were set in the model for all compartments in the morphology reconstruction. A simulated current injection of 70 picoAmperes  was applied to the soma for 400 ms and $I_{Input}$ was calculated from the difference between starting membrane potential and steady state over the amplitude of the current injection. While ${\\tau}_m$ was estimated by fitting an exponential to the hyperpolarisation transient from near starting membrane potential to the steady state (using the \"Octave expfit\" function http://octave.sourceforge.net/optim/function/expfit.html). Then a simulated voltage clamp was applied to the soma of the model (5 ms 5 mV, 5 ms 5 mV, 20 $M{\\Omega}$. $C_m$ was estimated by fitting an exponential to the second transient (again with \"Octave expfit\"). Iterations were repeated until the specific passive parameters set in the model replicated the experimental parameters.**\n",
